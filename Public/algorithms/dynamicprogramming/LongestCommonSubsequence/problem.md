## Longest Common Subsequence Problem

The Longest common subsequence problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in the set of sequences.



### Problem

Given two sequences X = {x1,x2,x3 .. xn} and Y = {y1,y2,y3 ... ym}. find the longest common subsequence of those two strings.
