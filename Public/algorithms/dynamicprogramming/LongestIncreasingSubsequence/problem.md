## Longest Increasing Subsequence Problem

The Longest increasing subsequence problem is to find the  subsequence of the given sequence in which elements are in the increasing order.

### Problem

Given a sequences X = {x1,x2,x3 .. xn}, we have to find a sequence Y ={Y1,Y2...Yk} such that Y1<=Y2<=Y3...<=Yk and k is of maximum value.
